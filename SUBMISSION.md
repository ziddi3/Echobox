# Hackathon Submission — Murmur Box: Dimensional Tuner

**Category:** Wildcard (eligible also for Best Local Agent)  
**Why this category?** It’s an embodied, offline, myth‑making scanner that fuses physical sensors with a local `gpt-oss` model. Unexpected, experiential, and not a standard app or robot.

## Project Description (features & functionality)
- Reads UV/IR light, magnetic flux, and barometric pressure; optional EMF coil and audio.  
- Detects anomalies/coincidences across sensors.  
- Summarizes observations into compact JSON.  
- A local `gpt-oss` model “mythologizes” each observation into a ShineChain codex page (text + metadata).  
- Speaks/prints/保存 artifacts; works fully offline.

## Public Repository

- `README.md` with setup + testing instructions.  
- `src/lore_engine.py` demonstrating use of a local OpenAI‑compatible `gpt-oss` server.  
- `data/samples/` with mock observations.
